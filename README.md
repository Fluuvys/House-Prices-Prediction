## 📖 Introduction
House prices are influenced by various factors such as location, size, and features. This project applies regression models to predict house prices based on available data. The goal is to find the best-performing model for accurate predictions.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). It contains various features describing houses, such as:
- 🏡 Lot size
- 🛏 Number of rooms
- 🏗 Year built
- 🚗 Garage size
- 📍 Neighborhood, etc.

## ⚙️ Installation
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Requirements include:
- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🐼 pandas
- 🔢 numpy
- 🤖 scikit-learn
- 📊 matplotlib
- 🎨 seaborn

## 🛠 Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing includes:
- 🛑 Handling missing values
- 🎭 Feature engineering
- 🔄 Encoding categorical variables
- 📏 Scaling numerical features
- ✂️ Splitting data into training and testing sets

## 📊 Model Training
Several machine learning models are tested, including:
- 🌲 Random Forest
  
Models are evaluated using metrics like:
- 📉 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- 📊 R² Score

## 📈 Evaluation
The best model is selected based on cross-validation performance. Hyperparameter tuning is done using GridSearchCV or Optuna.

## 🏆 Results
The final model achieves an RMSE of **X.XX** on the test set. Further improvements can be made using feature selection, ensemble learning, and deep learning techniques.
